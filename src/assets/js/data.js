        review: "He's so gentle, patient and taciturn. That's his best points of being a developer. If his patience and gentleness are put in the right place, he can sky rocket his capabilities. However, he's still pretty shy when socializing with others. He doesn't show off, but I hope he could be more self-confident. Last words, I really admire his practical programming skills and knowledge despite of his unmatched Bachelor's degree.",

        review: "He's got fast problem solving skills and kinda technically flexible at work. He knows how to collaborate and support others. I love him as he's such a gentle and patient guy. But probably because of his fast thinking behavior, he never seems to stop reasoning about everything.",

        review: "Nhan has a warm corner in my heart. He's friendly, willing to listen to advice and respects others. At work, responsibility and self-learning skills are his priorities. But, he's still not really confident about himself. I believe that he would be even more succesful in the industry if he learned to enhance his self-confidence.",

        review: "Nhan has a great manner of self-study, and learning from others. Though he's just joined the theme development for a couple of months, he could analyze and fix complex certain bugs of the theme. However, he still has much room for improvement, such as code management and his social skills. My message to Nhan: stop being shy, trust yourself more so that you can be the best of version of you. I believe in you.",

        review: "At work, he's really perceptive and a fast learner. In spite of not having graduated from any IT university, he's managed to transition to the programming field, which means he has a strong self-learning manner. Nhan is also detail-oriented and supportive to others. However, he's easy to get stressed somtimes, so I hope he would be able to deal with it in the future.",
